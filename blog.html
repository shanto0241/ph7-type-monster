			<h3 class="text-white px-4 pt-3">1. What is the difference between Local Storage And Session Storage?</h3>
			<p class="text-light px-5">
				sessionStorage is as same as to localStorage. 
				The difference is while data in the localStorage doesn't expire, 
				data in the sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
				 Also whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser,
				a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.			</p>

			<h3 class="text-white px-4 pt-3">2. What is the difference between Global Scope and Local Scope?</h3>
			<p class="text-light px-5">JavaScript variables have only two scopes.One is Global Scope and Other is Local Scope. 
				 Global Variables scope − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined 
				 anywhere in your JavaScript code. 
				 Local Variables scope − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.
				  Function parameters are always local to that function.	</p>

			<h3 class="text-white px-4 pt-3">3.How does the Js Event Loop Work?</h3>
			<p class="text-light px-5">The Event Loop has one simple job — 
				to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
				 which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.	</p>

			<h3 class="text-white px-4 pt-3">4. How many ways to get undefined?</h3>
			<p class="text-light px-5">We will get undefined value when we call a non-existent
				 property or method of an object. In example, when
				  a function Sum does not return any result but still we 
				try to assign its resulted value to a variable. Then, the result will be undefined.	</p>
